A PCB Renderer CLI tool that parses ECAD JSON files and generates visual representations (SVG, PNG, PDF) of printed circuit boards. Built for the Quilter Backend Engineer Code Challenge, it validates board designs against 14 error classes and provides deterministic, offline rendering suitable for automated testing. Uses Python 3.11+, Pydantic v2, and Matplotlib.
